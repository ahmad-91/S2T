# Metadata Tags

Respect `origin:` and `derived-from:` tags wherever applicable.

These tags indicate the source and lineage of requirements, designs, and code artifacts. They are critical for maintaining traceability throughout the project lifecycle.

## Usage Examples:
- `origin: /truth/TC.vX.md` - indicates the source of a requirement
- `derived-from: /requirements/SRS.md` - indicates what document this artifact was derived from

Always include these tags when creating derived artifacts to maintain clear traceability.
