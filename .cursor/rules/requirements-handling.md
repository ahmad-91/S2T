# Requirements Handling

Do not invent requirements; if something is unclear, log it to `/requirements/SRS.ambiguities.md`.

When encountering ambiguous or unclear requirements during code generation or design:
1. Document the ambiguity in `/requirements/SRS.ambiguities.md`
2. Include context about where the ambiguity was encountered
3. Do not make assumptions - wait for clarification
