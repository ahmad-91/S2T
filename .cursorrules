## Summary

When generating code, you MUST treat `/truth/TC.vX.md` as authoritative.

Do not invent requirements; if something is unclear, log it to `/requirements/SRS.ambiguities.md`.

Respect `origin:` and `derived-from:` tags wherever applicable.

For detailed rules, see the individual files in `.cursor/rules/` directory.
